# PulseBat Linear Regression Project

## Overview
This project predicts the State of Health (SOH) of a battery pack using Linear Regression. It includes dataset preprocessing and model training.  

The project was developed collaboratively by the group using PyCharm. All code is available in this repository.  

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Libraries** (install using `pip`):  
  - `pandas`  
  - `openpyxl`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `matplotlib`  

> **Tip:** PyCharm is recommended for running the code, but the scripts can also be run from the command line.  

## Repository Files

- **dataset_handling.py:** Loads the PulseBat dataset, checks for missing values, aggregates U1–U21 to calculate Pack_SOH, and saves `PulseBat_processed.csv` for model training.

- **train_model.py:** Loads the processed dataset, trains a Linear Regression model to predict SOH, evaluates model performance using R², MSE, and MAE, and plots predicted vs actual SOH.

- **data/PulseBat Dataset.xlsx:** The original dataset provided for the project.

- **data/PulseBat_processed.csv:** Processed dataset generated by `dataset_handling.py`. Contains aggregated Pack_SOH and is used for model training.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tanzina8/DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithms_Project.git
   cd DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithms_Project
3. **Install Python 3.x** if not already installed.  
4. **Install required libraries** by running the following in a terminal or PyCharm console:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl scikit-learn matplotlib
